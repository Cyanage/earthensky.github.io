To fit the darkness of this cave system I put a lot of effort into creating a strong and memorable baseline.  To convey the uncertainty of this sort of place I filled one section with bits of dissonance (in rhythm and pitch) and added a phaser to the instruments used to make the listener feel like something is off.  See 'Extras' for more information.</td>

                            The rhythm for this song is sort of messed up because I composed it on my ipad and don't have the ability to be able to edit recorded sound files.
                            <br><br>I wrote the lyrics from the perspective of an adult remeniscing about when they were younger and played in nature. I designed the lyrics to use odd combinations of words to fit with the illogical ideas and crazyness of childhood. To add some structure to the lyrics I decided to break up the song into the four seasons, starting in summer. This also helps reinforce the theme of nature.

                            <br>I lived under a tree,
                            <br>Watching the green sunset,
                            <br>Carefree.
                            <br>
                            <br>Wind trickles down from the mountain.
                            <br>** Break **
                            <br>Copper leaves fall.
                            <br>** Break **
                            <br>
                            <br>Silent wisps disappear.
                            <br>I sat under frozen branches.
                            <br>
                            <br>By a fireplace,
                            <br>New things live.
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            <br>My forest rings,
                            <br>Water through the air,
                            <br>Under a tree.

                <h2 style="margin: 0.25em">Research Information:</h2>
                <p class="small-txt">
                    The first part of my research is small summaries of different elements of music or concepts that I researched.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Texture</b> -> A combination of tempo, melody, and harmony.  This is all the raw notes and when they are played. Texture is usually described in the sense of the range and frequency of notes. Lots of notes played quickly or many layers of instruments sounds thick, while fewer layers or notes feels thin. Texture is also affected by the timbre of an instrument or the voices used.  Texture is described with the terms thin/thick, wide/narrow, and light/heavy.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Common Types of Textures:</b>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Monophonic</b> -> A single melodic line  with no accompanying instruments / lines.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Biphonic</b> -> Two distinct lines, a lower drone melody and a higher melody above it.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Polyphonic / Contrapuntal</b> -> More than one melodic voices which are independent from eachother.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Homophonic</b> -> Multiple voices with one main melody and multiple harmonic accompanyments. Rhythmic similarity.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Heterophonic</b> -> Two or more voices playing variations of the same melody simultaneously.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Textural Elements:</b> -> Knowing the textural elements helps in analysing texture in songs. (in more depth)
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>A. Melodic Elements</b> -> "The Melodies"
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>- Primary Melody</b> -> The most important or significant melody.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>- Secondary Melody</b> -> Melodies that are less significant than the primary melody but are still independent.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>- Parallel Supporting Melody</b> -> Have a similar contour to another Primary or Secondary melody.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>B. Supporting Elements</b> -> "The Flavour"
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>- Static Support</b> -> Sustained tones (drones), repeated melodies (arpeggios), and ostanti.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>- Harmonic Support</b> -> An element of accompaniment that provides a harmonic background to the melody. Often seen as long sustained notes or chords.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>- Rhythmic Support</b> -> An element of accompaniment that provides a rhythmic background to the melody. This is seen as a drum track or with general percussion instruments.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>C. Timbral Elements</b> -> The individual timbre of each voice and how it affects the texture.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Timbre</b> -> The sound quality or colour of an individual musical note.  Timbre is what determines the difference between two notes with the same pitch and loudness.  Changing settings on a synthesizer changes the timbre of the ntoes produced. Different envelopes also count as different timbres.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Pedal Tone</b> -> A droning bass note that starts out dissonant but then the key changes to make it consonant.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Motif</b> -> A short musical phrase that often repeats.  It is a recognizable aspect of a piece and carries some meaning.  Motifs are what make up thematic identity. (Themes with significant associated meaning)
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Theme / Subject</b> -> A suject is the material (or regognizable melody) which a composition is based off of.  A subject is similar to a motif except a subject is more of a complete phrase than an idea.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Melodic Movement</b> -> The change in pitch between two notes.  Large / short leaps up / down.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Contour</b> -> The curve that is the change in pitch over time.  Usually just a single voice.  Similar to melodic movement.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Counterpoint / Contrapuntal</b> -> The relationship between voices independent in harmony and rhythm.  Examples of counterpoint:
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Rounds</b> -> Singing the same melody but starting at different times. Melody must be designed to sound good at different points.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Contrapuntal Inversion</b> -> This is when low and high voices switch places.  --I think this is a really cool effect.--
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Voice Leading</b> -> How the different lines of melodies combine to form a whole.  Must follow certain rules.  The progression of each separate line of a contrapuntal section of music, although it's "not just for contrapuntal melodies."
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Mode</b> -> This is a type of scale combined with melodic behaviours.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Ornament</b> -> Ornaments are flourishes that accompany the overall melody and serve to decorate a melodic line by adding variety or expressiveness.  Ornaments are often a lot of fast notes around a main note.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Ostinato</b> -> A short motif that persistantly repeats in the same voice. Can just be thought of as a small repeating melody.
                    <br>
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Candence</b> -> This is a melodic pattern that creates a sense of resolution or completion.  This is often accomplished by ending a melody on the tonic note.

                    Notes:
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;1.) The instrument playing the secondary melody gain focus and becomes the primary melody.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;2.) The section is static and rhythmic support because it has a dissonant effect on the rhythm as well as being static support.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;3.) This section is harmonic and rhythmic support because it is the harmonic background but also changes the rhythm.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;4.) This part is actually two layers being played by one instrument, a higher pitched parallel supporting melody and a lower pitched harmonic support.
